# Troubleshooting

Please take advantage of the many BB2260 resources available to you through 96Boards, MediaTek, and Coursera

- [96Boards BB2260 Forum]()
   - The DragonBoard has its very own 96Boards forum. If you can't find a pre-existing thread that addresses your issue, start your own and let the community help out!
- [BB2260 Forum]()
   - Similar to the 96Boards forum; however, this page will have threads for all MediaTek products
- [BB2260]()
   - Buy the BB2260 here! 
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/internet-of-things)
   - BB2260 uses the same specification! Students from the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) put together an "Internet of Things" (IoT) course focused around the DragonBoard 410c (again, same specification as BB2260!). It is free to audit, or you can purchase the specialization package for a cool certificate!
- [Report a bug!](../../../Report_a_bug.md)
   - Instructions on how to report bugs for any of our 96Boards hardware and software, this includes the BB2260!
- [Board Recovery](../Installation/BoardRecovery.md)
   - Bricked board? Many software issues can be fixed with a simple "board recovery"
